This program helps speed the interpretation of snowtography images.  It consists of two parts: 
selecting the stake locations and defining the locations of the markings, and then measurement 
of snow depth on each of the images.  Instead of manually reading off the depth and entering the 
number into a spreadsheet, you click the snow surface (where it touches the snow stake) and the 
program uses the location of the mouse clicks to record the depth automatically, which saves 
time during interpretation.  The best way to understand the program is to follow the demo.
